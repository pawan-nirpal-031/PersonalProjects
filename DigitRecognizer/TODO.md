# Goals 
1) optimize memory footprint using pointers
2) automate passing model params/settings using config file to avoid recompiling
3) include data params into the config
4) optimize core operations on matrices using OpenMP
5) See if GPU can be used to peform matrix ops
6) Export trained model to a format for later inference.

## Up-next 
1) [BUG] - check why error rate does not go down.
